Map
===

Escher uses the same format as escher for the maps. Maps from escher can be imported
using the Map button (web app) or with drag and drop (native app).

The only difference is that the histogram position, rotation and scale (which
does not exist in escher) can be exported to the map (only native app for now)
using the `Export` drop down on the `Settings` window. This allows to save a
map with the correct manually fixed positions where different data can be
plotted for the same or different projects.
