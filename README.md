## What?

App to plot multidimensional data to a metabolic map. Metabolic maps are graphs with metabolites
as nodes and reactions as edges.

For a **quick start**, we provide a web application at https://biosustain.github.io/shu. There
are example maps and data available at https://github.com/biosustain/shu_case_studies, that
can be load with the buttons at the top-right.

For a more comprehensive guide, visit the [documentation](https://biosustain.github.io/shu/docs/plotting.html).

## Why?

[Escher](https://escher.github.io/#/) is great. In fact, the format
of the map is exactly the same as escher's. However, escher only allows for plotting 2 (+2 with tooltips)
kinds of data: reaction data and metabolite data. **Shu** attempts to provide ways of plotting at least
6:

- [x] Reaction sizes.
- [x] Reaction colors.
- [x] Reaction right sides.
- [x] Reaction left sides.
- [x] Metabolite sizes.
- [x] Metabolite colors.

(+2 with hovers):
- [x] Hover reactions.
- [x] Hover metabolites.

with special focus on being able to plot **distributions** (not just points) and **n-conditions**. Escher also has the
distinction between color and size, it is simply that they are not independently accessible from the GUI.

## How to use

Shu is distributed both through a web app (preview build at https://biosustain.github.io/shu) and as standalone
native application. To use the latter, download the [latest release for your operating system](https://github.com/biosustain/shu/releases/latest), unpack if necessary and run it as executable.

Documentation for the rust crate and the python API will be made available once they are published. In the meantime, a preview
of the python documentation can be found at https://biosustain.github.io/shu/docs.

### Building from source (latest master commit)

Install [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/biosustain/shu.git
cd shu
cargo install --path .
```

This may possibly require extra dependencies. Check the bevy setup, **shu** uses `lld`
to fasten linking times.

## API design
 
Shu follows a Grammar of Graphics design like [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) or [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
See the [python API](ggshu/README.rst) for the full analogy. The particular implementation
is an Entity Component System in [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/):

* Each aesthetic is a *component* (`Gsize`, `Gcolor`, etc.) containing its data (see [`src/aesthetics.rs`](src/aesthetics.rs)). Identifiers are stored in the `Aesthetic` *component*.
* *Entities* with `Aesthetic`, other aes components and Geom component (`GeomArrow`, `GeomMetabolite`, etc. in [`src/geom.rs`](src/geom.rs)) are
processed and plotted by a *system* (in [`src/aesthetics.rs`](src/aesthetics.rs)).
* The accepted aesthetics for a given geom are made explicit in the *queries* of the *systems*.

Data handling (`df`, ad `map_file`) lives in [`src/data.rs`](src/data.rs) and
[`src/escher.rs`](src/escher.rs) and the GUI componets lives in [`src/gui.rs`](src/gui.rs).
